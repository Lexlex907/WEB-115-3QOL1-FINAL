**My website has three main pages: a homepage with a welcome message and navigation, an about page with my introduction and a contact form, and a projects page showcasing my work with images and links. I used HTML5 and CSS3 to build and style everything. The biggest challenge was making sure all the navigation links worked perfectly and keeping the design consistent across all the pages.
