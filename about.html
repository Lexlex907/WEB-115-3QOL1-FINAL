        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Alexis Farmer, and I am currently completing my final year at Nash Community College, where I am earning my degree in web design and administration. I have a deep passion for technology, especially how it intersects with creative fields like beauty and fashion. My dream is to blend technology and data analytics to create inclusive, innovative beauty solutions that can make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in web design, data analysis, and project management. My projects often reflect my commitment to delivering user-friendly, responsive designs that prioritize inclusivity and creativity. I believe technology has the power to improve lives, and I aim to showcase this through every project I create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new creative outlets, from designing press-on nails to experimenting with different ways technology can enhance everyday life. My goal is to combine my love of beauty with my technical skills to contribute to an evolving, diverse industry.
